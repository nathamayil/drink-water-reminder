# drink-water-reminder
Just a simple Python script that alerts the user to drink water with a notification (I desperately need this lol)
Feel free to modify the notification text to suit yourself.

# Packages Involved

Used the Plyer package for the notification and the time package to import sleep function

# How to Install Plyer?

Use the following command in the terminal 'pip install plyer' and you're good to go!

# Cloning this Repo
 1) Open the terminal and enter the following commands:

    cd

2) Run the file like how you'd normally run a python file (I used Jupyter Notebook)
    python main.py

# How to disable the Notif?
  You can go to Task Manager, locate Python, right-click it and end the task.
